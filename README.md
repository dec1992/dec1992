# Dec Burns // Software Engineer

My flair for problem solving and fascination for technology led me to begin self-teaching software development. I discovered a passion for programming while working on my own ecommerce startup, before making the decision to fast-track my learning at General Assembly with a full-stack immersive bootcamp. 


I have been continuing my development through various roles in fast-paced startups with increasing seniority and responsibility, typically working as part of a team in an agile environment. I am consistently learning new skills and technologies working on projects for various clients, most recently in my current role as a senior developer at Moropo. I specialise in using technologies such as Typescript, React, React Native, Expo, MobX, Node/Deno, PostgreSQL, and Supabase - among others.
