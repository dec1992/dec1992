# Dec Burns // Software Engineer


### General Assembly Student on their Sortware Engineer Immersive program.

My flair for problem solving and fascination for technology led me to begin self-teaching software development. I discovered a passion for programming while working on an ecommerce website, before expanding my knowledge with books and online resources. 

I made the decision to fast-track my learning at General Assembly with a full-stack immersion into JavaScript, Node.js, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Python with Flask and an overall focus on a MERN stack. Iâ€™m now looking to progress my career in the tech industry as a junior developer.
